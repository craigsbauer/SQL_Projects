-- 1a. You need a list of all the actors who have Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

-- 1b. -- Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name
SELECT concat(column1, column2) as FullName 
FROM actor
SELECT UPPER(LEFT(word,1))+LOWER(SUBSTRING(word,2,LEN(word))) FROM [actor];

-- 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT actor_id FROM actor 
    WHERE first_name = "Joe";

-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
SELECT * from actor
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%GEN%';

-- 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT * from actor
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%'
	ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;

-- 2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
SELECT country_id, country
FROM country
WHERE country in ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');

-- 3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Position it between first_name and last_name. Hint: you will need to specify the data type.
ALTER TABLE actor 
ADD COLUMN middle_name INT NOT NULL after first_name;


-- 3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. Change the data type of the middle_namecolumn to blobs.

-- 3c. Now delete the middle_name column.
ALTER TABLE actor DROP middle_name;

-- 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT last_name from actor;


-- 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT last_name)
  FROM actor;


-- 4c. -- Oh, no! The actor HARPO WILLIAMS was accidentally entered in the actor table as GROUCHO WILLIAMS, the name of Harpo's second cousin's husband's yoga teacher. Write a query to fix the record.
UPDATE actor set first_name = replace(designation, 'Harpo', 'Groucho') where first_name ='Harpo';


-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name 
-- after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO. 
-- Otherwise, change the first name to MUCHO GROUCHO, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO MUCHO GROUCHO, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)


-- 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
CREATE SCHEMA sakila;  
GO;  


-- 6a. Use JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:

SELECT a.staff, c.address
FROM staff a RIGHT JOIN address c
ON a.address = c.address_id;
SELECT first_name, last_name, address






-- 6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.

-- 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

-- 6d. How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory system?

-- 6e. Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:
-- ![Total amount paid](Images/total_payment.png)

-- 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.

-- 7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film Alone Trip.


-- 8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.


-- 8b. How would you display the view that you created in 8a?

-- 8c. You find that you no longer need the view top_five_genres. Write a query to delete it.
